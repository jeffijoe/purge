# purge

Utility for deleting directories that contain files/subdirectories
with long path names.

## Get it

Download [purge.exe](/dist) from the dist folder.

## Usage

Pretty simple. It takes one argument; the folder path.

```
purge <folder>
```

Or, build it yourself.

## Why?

Because deleting `node_modules` manually is a pain.

## Wishlish

* Explorer Shell integration. Probably not happening because I don't C++.
